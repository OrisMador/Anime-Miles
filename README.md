# Anime-Miles
I put anime in my Spiderman Game. Now you can have it too!
Some non Marvel graffiti has been replaced with a variety of anime styled images ranging from wholesome to lewd and/or offensive. Visit https://www.nexusmods.com/spidermanmilesmorales/?tab=popular+%28all+time%29 to find the mod installer and go ham. Lots of other mods with proper work put in too.

Take these files and do what you want with them. Credit is nice but not required if you want to make your own version based off this one.

Enjoy!
